# React Advice App

This is a simple React application that fetches advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/).

## How it works

The main component, `App.jsx`, does the following:

- Fetches a random piece of advice from the API when the "get advice" button is clicked.
- Displays the advice on the screen.
- Counts and displays the number of times you have requested advice.
- You can clear the displayed advice.
